First_Attempt_20140605

Getting started with GitHUB.
Working on collaboration issues in Ship design projects.
First on visualization using WEB GL.
Now trying to fork the following projects:

Visualizer:
http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/car-visualizer/?f=
http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/car-visualizer-classics/?f=
>> turn it into a ship visualizer, with a library of 3d models of ships and backgrounds such as a shipyard, repairing dock, and eventually a rendered ocean.
!! did not find the code but wrote to the creators to ask


final rendering: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2458333,00.asp

wave rendering:http://david.li/waves/
!! code http://david.li/waves/waves.js

another wave rendering:  http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/
!! no code available but a lot on https://github.com/evanw
!! check the basic 3D visualizer from Evan threejs


Animated texture:can we make a displacement map instead of it?

!! many examples of simple steps with Threejs http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/

Another example of displacement map

!! didn't find the code but found instead a sandbox

================= Message to +360 degrees (Car visualizer) =============
http://www.plus360degrees.com/
Dear +360 degrees!
Congratulations for your amazing work. I'm starting a PhD research project on how to visualize a ship design process, together with the The Oslo School for Architecture and Design in Norway. I want to make first a ship visualizer, basically the same as your car visualizer, except it would have ships instead of cars. And in a later stage I want to have different backgrounds, like a virtual shipyard, and eventually a real ocean, adding some physics to make the ship float and move with the waves.
So I was basically wondering if you would be ready to share the code of your car visualizer, or if you could point me towards another similar code I could reuse? Thanks a lot in advance for your help and have a very nice day!
All the best,
Etienne
